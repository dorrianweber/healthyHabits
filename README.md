## General Info

Healthy Habits start with knowing what you do today!
A user can take control of their life. Track healthy (and unhealthy) habits like calories, sleeping, and spending so that they can make changes and keep track of their growth!

The app will keep track of your spending, eating, and sleep habits! Take it slow and track your progress 1 week at a time. Small steps to lasting results!

1. User Story - User wants to improve habits. The website will help the user log their information, track performance, and take the steps to improve.
2. Project description - Healthy Habits! Critical to making lasting changes. In order to help you get started on the process our site helps with logging eating habits, sleeping habits, and spending habits. There is an old saying, what gets measured get done, or improved. A user can enter their information, select a goal, and determine how they are doing on a weekly basis. No hassle, no pressure, the user sees what they do today and decides to improve or stay the same.

## Future Scope

Future scope would be to add:

1. Setting goals - Goal setting enhancement, so the user can compare goals to actual results.

2. Email progress - Email users weekly progress report on how they are doing. Inform them of goals met or not met, medals earned, and goal reminders to keep users on track

3. Active lifestyle events search - Give users the ability to search for active events (i.e. walking, running, etc.) in their area. This would further help the user with adding healthy habits

4. Social media - Add a social media option, so that users can compete with friends, share progress, and motivate each other.
